  # EXTREME FAST mode configuration
  # When enabled, skips waiting for the bonding curve to stabilize and RPC price check.
  # The bot calculates token amount based on platform starting price and buy_amount for precision.

# Priority fee configuration
# Manage transaction speed and cost on the Solana network.
# Note: dynamic mode requires an additional RPC call, which slows down the buying process.

# Blockhash caching configuration
# Optimize RPC calls by caching recent blockhash
blockhash:
  update_interval: 15.0 # Update cached blockhash every 15 seconds (default: 10.0)
  # Note: Solana blockhashes are valid for ~150 slots (~60-90 seconds)
