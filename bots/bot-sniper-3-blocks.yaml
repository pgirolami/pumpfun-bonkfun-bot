# Trading parameters
# Control trade execution: amount of SOL per trade and acceptable price deviation
trade:
  buy_amount: 0.0001 # Amount of SOL to spend when buying (in SOL)
  buy_slippage: 0.3 # Maximum acceptable price deviation (0.3 = 30%)

  #stop_loss_percentage: 0.1 # Stop loss at 10% loss (0.1 = 10%)
  max_hold_time: 15 # Maximum hold time in seconds
  #price_check_interval: 2 # Check price every 2 seconds

  # EXTREME FAST mode configuration
  # When enabled, skips waiting for the bonding curve to stabilize and RPC price check.
  # The bot buys the specified number of tokens directly, making the process faster but less precise.
  extreme_fast_mode: true
  extreme_fast_token_amount: 20 # Amount of tokens to buy

# Priority fee configuration
# Manage transaction speed and cost on the Solana network.
# Note: dynamic mode requires an additional RPC call, which slows down the buying process.
priority_fees:
  enable_dynamic: false # Use latest transactions to estimate required fee (getRecentPrioritizationFees)
  enable_fixed: true # Use fixed amount below
  fixed_amount: 200_000 # Base fee in microlamports
  extra_percentage: 0.0 # Percentage increase on riority fee regardless of the calculation method (0.1 = 10%)
  hard_cap: 200_000 # Maximum allowable fee in microlamports to prevent excessive spending

# Compute unit limits for transaction processing
# Operation-specific defaults are used if not specified: buy=100K, sell=60K
compute_units:
  # Override default CU limits for this platform
  # buy: 100_000    # Buy operations (ATA creation + trading)
  # sell: 60_000    # Sell operations (just trading)

  # Account data size optimization (reduces CU cost and improves tx priority)
  # Reduces CU cost from 16k to ~128 CU by limiting loaded account data.
  # Default is 64MB (16k CU). Setting to 512KB significantly reduces overhead.
  # Note: Savings don't show in "consumed CU" but improve tx priority/cost.
